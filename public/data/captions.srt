1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:11,240
I'm fascinated by natural selection the

2
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:13,250
idea that incredible complexity and

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,910
environmental adaptation is a

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,740
consequence of small random changes it

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,780
should be no surprise that I've been a

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,450
fan of the primer YouTube channel for

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,430
quite a while the channel digs deep into

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:29,860
ideas of evolution by natural selection

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:33,110
and more I'm also a fan of simulations

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,420
obviously so when primer released a

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,910
video titled simulating natural

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,180
selection my programmers fingers got

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:43,190
itchy I like learning by playing I

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,800
wanted to get my hands on the controls

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,020
and see what other kinds of things I

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,760
could learn from these cute unassuming

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:55,399
blob creatures that was a year ago since

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,590
then I got in touch with Justin and took

19
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,370
on the task of giving his blob creatures

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:04,009
a new home in a web browser this is the

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,959
evolution simulator I tried to keep it

22
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:08,600
as similar to the original as I could

23
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,700
but since I had to rewrite everything

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,729
from scratch there might be a few minor

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:18,020
differences let's go through the laws

26
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:20,569
governing blob world first in any

27
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,459
generation every blob needs to eat one

28
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:24,319
piece of food and return to the edge of

29
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:27,289
the world to survive to the next

30
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:31,009
generation if a blob gets two pieces of

31
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:33,049
food then it will reproduce but blobs

32
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,999
have a fixed amount of energy they can

33
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,520
use every day to move around finding

34
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:41,929
food and the rate that they use up

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,109
energy depends on three traits first

36
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:46,999
trade is sight range blobs will move in

37
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:49,999
a random way until a piece of food

38
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:51,799
enters their range vision once a blob

39
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:54,919
can see food it will move straight

40
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:57,390
towards it and eat it that is unless

41
00:01:54,919 --> 00:02:02,160
another blob beats them to it

42
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:05,120
which brings us to the next rate the

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,729
speed trait is how fast a blob can move

44
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,710
there's not much more to say than that

45
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:12,750
you can enable a speed indicator that

46
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,200
makes the faster blobs a brighter red

47
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,910
color as shown here the third trait is

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,770
size here's where things get interesting

49
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,130
larger blobs can eat smaller blobs if

50
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,600
they are at least 20% larger and if they

51
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,880
are fast enough to catch them

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,920
I should mention one in specific

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,380
difference between the primer simulation

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,580
and mine and that has to do with how

55
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,700
speed works

56
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,709
I noticed that really tiny blobs could

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,010
move lightning-fast because their size

58
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:47,400
and speed weren't related at all this

59
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,350
looked weird to me a blob the size of an

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,330
ant shouldn't be able to keep up with a

61
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,840
default sized blob under normal

62
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:58,110
circumstances so what I did was I

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,030
coupled the speed and size together if a

64
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,580
blob is larger it will be able to move

65
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,150
faster than a smaller blob with the same

66
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,150
speed value think of it like how fast

67
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,280
your limbs can move if you can take the

68
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,590
same number of steps per second as an

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,600
ant you will cover more distance just

70
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,420
because of the fact that you're gigantic

71
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,060
compared to the end anyways seeing

72
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,130
farther moving faster and using fellow

73
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,890
blobs as a source of food are certainly

74
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,580
advantages but each of them comes with a

75
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,190
cost

76
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,989
as they say there's no such thing as a

77
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:35,910
free lunch and these blobs pay in energy

78
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:39,000
every time a blob moves it loses energy

79
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:43,320
proportional to its site range plus its

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,209
size cubed times its speed squared we

81
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,850
could have chosen any energy cost

82
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,040
relationship we like but Justin chose

83
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,230
this energy cost to resemble the formula

84
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,070
for kinetic energy which makes a lot of

85
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,840
sense when blobs manage to eat two bits

86
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,079
of food and return to the edge of the

87
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,019
board they are able to reproduce this

88
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,000
means the blob is duplicated but each of

89
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,190
the duplicates traits are bumped up or

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,580
down by our

91
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,560
random amount for example for any given

92
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,890
blobs offspring there's an equal chance

93
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,430
of it being larger or smaller faster or

94
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:22,040
slower seeing farther or being condemned

95
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,290
to wander alone in the darkness unaware

96
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,380
of the scrumptious green Ward's waiting

97
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,390
beyond the edge of its nose that is to

98
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,580
say there's nothing built into the

99
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,200
simulation that forces younger blobs to

100
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,440
be better at reproducing than their

101
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,560
parents we don't even know what better

102
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,410
would be exactly but we don't need to

103
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,800
given enough time a large populations

104
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,810
traits will on average evolve towards an

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,290
optimum for survival in the current

106
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,870
environment blobs that by chance have

107
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,570
traits closer to the optimum will have a

108
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,550
higher chance of reproducing and their

109
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,620
offspring will have trait values closer

110
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,260
to those successful parents than the

111
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,390
rest of the population you can get an

112
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,360
overview of this adaptation by looking

113
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,280
at the trends page this shows how the

114
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,310
traits of the blob population change

115
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,310
over time the brightest line is the

116
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:18,260
average value of the trait the region

117
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,480
around the average is the standard

118
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,980
deviation which gives you an idea of how

119
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,160
spread out the values are in the

120
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,710
population the highest and lowest lines

121
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,960
are the maximum and minimum values for

122
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,710
the trait they correspond to the blobs

123
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,750
at the top and bottom of the pack for

124
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,940
example with these parameters when we

125
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,460
look at site range we can see a bunch of

126
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,310
generations where there is a huge spread

127
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,410
in the standard deviation we can switch

128
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,900
back to the worldview look at a

129
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,669
generation around this time and turn on

130
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,669
the site range indicators to see the

131
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:55,370
street value for every blob some of

132
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,850
these circles are really big and others

133
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,320
are really small there's a lot of

134
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,290
deviation in the site range in this

135
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,450
generation but switching back to the

136
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,310
trends page we can see a bunch of

137
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,870
generations where the standard deviation

138
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,910
in the site range is small

139
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,620
if we look at the blob world around that

140
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,550
time we can see that the sight range

141
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,410
circles are roughly the same size if you

142
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,300
experiment with this a bit you can

143
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,540
notice some really interesting things

144
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,090
about how the blobs evolve for example

145
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,460
we can change how different baby blobs

146
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,729
will be from their parents by changing

147
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,070
the mutation variants in the settings if

148
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:38,010
we have a mutation variants in the size

149
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,260
trait of around 1 that means the baby

150
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,600
blobs will have a chance of being bigger

151
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,840
or smaller than their parents by a value

152
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,850
of around 1 let's turn up the playback

153
00:06:45,840 --> 00:07:02,190
speed and watch the blobs evolve for a

154
00:06:47,850 --> 00:07:04,289
while notice that the small blobs are

155
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,780
usually the last to find food

156
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:09,539
that's because being small is much more

157
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,610
energy efficient so smaller blobs can

158
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:14,729
wander around looking for food for

159
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,460
longer if we focus on one of the large

160
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:20,100
blobs we can see that all it has time to

161
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,720
do is chase a smaller blob and eat it

162
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,380
before it runs out of energy

163
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,990
and has to return home a smaller blob on

164
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,660
the other hand can wander a very long

165
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,090
time before running out of energy so

166
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,669
there's a selection pressure towards

167
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,950
being smaller because smaller blobs can

168
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:41,250
spend more time looking for two pieces

169
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:43,229
of food and if we look at the trend for

170
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,169
the size trait we can see that it

171
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:50,639
decreases from a value of 10 down to

172
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:52,770
around 8 in 600 generations so what

173
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,289
happens if we decrease the mutation

174
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,419
variance in the size trait so that baby

175
00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:00,180
blobs are less different than their

176
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,160
parents will the average size decrease

177
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,670
slower than before because they are

178
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,570
mutating their size less

179
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:11,060
turns out to be the opposite in 600

180
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,330
generations the size decreases to seven

181
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,030
instead of nine so if the blobs are

182
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:20,540
mutating less why does their average

183
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,520
size evolve faster if we compare the two

184
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,490
worlds we can see why this could be the

185
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,460
case in the first world there were blobs

186
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,770
of many different sizes competition was

187
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,780
fierce and if a blob happened to be

188
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,640
smaller than the average there was a

189
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:38,360
larger chance that it was small enough

190
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,760
to be eaten by a bigger blob but in this

191
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,240
new world where the variation in size

192
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:47,360
between blobs is small most blobs are

193
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,300
roughly the same size so there's almost

194
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,000
no chance of being next to another blob

195
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,430
that is big enough to pose a threat in

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,460
other words there's no cost and being

197
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,610
slightly smaller so the average will

198
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,860
decrease at a steady rate this is a good

199
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,690
thing to keep in mind just because

200
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,300
there's a huge amount of mutation

201
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,240
doesn't mean evolution happens faster

202
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,720
the speed of evolution depends on the

203
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,040
Selective pressures in the environment

204
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,690
there's something else I noticed when

205
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,990
playing around with this that I found

206
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:24,080
really amazing it has to do with the age

207
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:27,320
of the blobs the age is how many

208
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,500
generations a blob has existed so far a

209
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,290
newly born blob for example will have an

210
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,390
age of zero and if it survives to the

211
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,690
next generation it will have an age of

212
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,940
one the weird thing is this

213
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,940
the average age of the blobs in a

214
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,970
generation grows to around two and then

215
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:51,259
levels off no matter how I changed the

216
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,459
settings it does this every time it

217
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,620
looks like there must be some

218
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:58,699
fundamental rule here to be discovered

219
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,680
so why does this happen I actually think

220
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:04,490
this explanation deserves its own video

221
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,410
so I'll save it for another time until

222
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,379
then you're welcome to try to figure it

223
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,970
out for yourself and I'd love to hear in

224
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,860
the comments what kinds of behaviors and

225
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,980
trends you notice while playing around

226
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,600
with this as usual thanks so much to

227
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,910
those of you supporting me on patreon

228
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,920
and I should mention that there's

229
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,860
another way to support me that would

230
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,259
actually help me out even more I've

231
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:30,170
enabled github sponsors on my projects

232
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:32,360
if you have a github account you can go

233
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,149
over to my profile or a minute labs

234
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,180
github repository and click the sponsor

235
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:41,360
button if you sponsor bean by any amount

236
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,639
I get every penny of that money not only

237
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,730
that but github will match every

238
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:49,339
donation I get through github sponsors

239
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,399
which effectively doubles all donations

240
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:55,069
and no additional cost to you so I hope

241
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,870
you consider doing that if you do let me

242
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:59,019
know and I can add you to the list of

243
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,269
minute labs beta-testers if you'd like

244
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,439
soon enough I'll be releasing

245
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:05,509
enhancements to the evolution simulator

246
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:08,779
to allow you to change how the blobs

247
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:12,140
behave even more so I'll see you again

248
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:23,140
sooner than usual with something new

249
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:23,140
